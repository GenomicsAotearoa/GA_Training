          <p><a href="https://www.genomics-aotearoa.org.nz/"> <b>Genomics Aotearoa</b></a> (GA) is a collaborative platform established to ensure that New Zealand is internationally participating and leading in the fields of genomics and bioinformatics. One of GAâ€™s projects which is critical to genomics research is bioinformatics capability where bioinformatics tools and strategies needed to analyze information are provided. The bioinformatics capability project aims to address the increasing local demand for data analysis methods as well as training. The concept is: develop material/pipelines that can be accessed by everyone and travel to offer hand-on bioinformatics workshop. Post-doctoral researchers with strong bioinformatics background have been brought on board to develop open-source and reusable data analysis material and pipelines to benefit the genomics research community. A training coordinator has also been hired to assist with the coordination and organization of NZ-wide training workshops and interact with GA researchers and other relevant individuals to determine training needs and priorities. At this stage development of introductory, intermediate and advanced bioinformatics training material for genomics researchers is underway. Together with our partner, NeSI, coordination and delivery of data science and bioinformatics training workshops has already begun around the country. </p>
